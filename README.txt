In this project, I implemented HRL in the grid_world.PNG.
To launch the code, you need to launch Start.py
In Start.py, if you import option.py, then they will only be Q_Learning in the HRL and for intra-option, policy is optimal.
If you import option_bonus.py, then there is also intra_option Q_learning
